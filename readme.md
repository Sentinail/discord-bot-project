This is a test Discord bot created to enhance my skills in developing Discord bots. It's built using Node.js and the discord.js library.

- Sends direct messages to users.

## Commands

- `say_hello`: Replies with a direct message to the user who invoked the command.
- `say_hello_to_all`: Sends a direct message to all users in the server.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Discord token, client ID, and guild ID:

```env
